This is a simple and flexible plugin that allows to use polls in worpress site and bbpress forums.

== Description ==
Just put a shortcode into your post or page and the plugin will display a poll.
You can also use Poll quicktag button to automate this process a bit.

Votes are assigned to the site user, **you must be logged in to vote.**

**[poll question='Was it difficult?' answers='Yes,No']**

All tags are easily customizable via Settings page, so you can adapt them to your page or language.
There are several different types of polls available.

Examples available on a sample page:
